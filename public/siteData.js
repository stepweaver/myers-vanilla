    {
      question: 'At what age should my child first see an orthodontist?',
      answer: 'The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that children have their first orthodontic evaluation by age 7. This allows us to identify any potential issues early and determine the optimal time to begin treatment if needed.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does orthodontic treatment typically take?',
      answer: 'Treatment time varies depending on the individual case, but most patients wear braces for 18-24 months. Some minor cases may be completed in as little as 6 months, while more complex cases may take up to 36 months.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do braces hurt?',
      answer: 'You may experience some discomfort when your braces are first placed and after adjustment appointments, but this is typically mild and temporary. Most patients describe it as pressure rather than pain.'
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Invisalign and braces?",
      answer: 'Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable aligners to gradually move teeth, while braces use brackets and wires that are fixed to the teeth. Invisalign is nearly invisible and can be removed for eating and cleaning, but requires strict patient compliance.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How often will I need to come in for appointments?',
      answer: 'Most patients with braces come in every 6-8 weeks for adjustments. Invisalign patients typically have appointments every 8-10 weeks to receive new sets of aligners.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you accept insurance?',
      answer: 'We accept most major insurance plans and will help verify your benefits before treatment. We also offer flexible payment plans and financing options.'
    }
  ],

  // Process-specific FAQ data
  processFaq: [
    {
      question: 'How long does treatment typically take?',
      answer: 'Treatment duration varies depending on the complexity of your case, but most patients complete treatment in 12-36 months. We\'ll provide a specific timeline during your consultation.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will treatment be painful?',
      answer: 'Most patients experience mild discomfort for a few days after initial placement and adjustments. This is normal and indicates that your teeth are moving. We provide tips to manage any discomfort.'
